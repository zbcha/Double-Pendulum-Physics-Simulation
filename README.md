G (Gravity) set in 9.81 by default.
L1 (Pendulum arm length of the first mass)
L2 (Pendulum arm length of the second mass)
m1 (Mass of pendulum 1)
m2 (Mass of pendulum 2)
d1 (Initial degree of pendulum 1)
d2 (Initial degree of pendulum 2)
v1 (Initial velocity of pendulum 1)
v2 (Initial velocity of pendulum 2)
time_span (The second number in the tuple is the total length of the video)
